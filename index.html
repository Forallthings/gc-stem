        <h2>The Roman Gladius</h2>

        <p id="sword">The Roman Gladius was a sword used by roman soldiers. The double edge allowed it to be used in both directions without having to rotate the sword each time. A sharp point meant it could be used in strong thrusting attacks, designed to pierce through the armor of that age. The gladius had a counterbalance on the end so that the wielder could perform many attacks in a string, without getting tired by holding up the point of the sword. It was fairly short,  allowing for many Roman soldiers to attack in a formation without having to worry about the sword hitting one of their own. This was a sword that truely could live up to the Roman standard.</p>
        <h3>The Hasta (Roman Spear)</h3>

        <p id="spear">The hasta was wielded by men called Hastati. These Hastati would not typically be highly trained, though they may have some simple training. They wore lighter armor than the legionaires, and fought in the front ranks of battle. They would be equipped with the gladius, as well as a small shield, the scuta, but their main weapon was an iron-tipped throwing spear: the Hasta. This spear would be short (as spears go) but would be long enough that they would stick out from behind a shield, forming a formidable wall when these soldiers would be in formation. The spears could be thrown over a considerable range, due to their light weight, allowing a stand-alone Hastati to become almost as fearsome as an archer. </p>
